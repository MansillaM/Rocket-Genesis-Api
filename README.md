# Project Readme

This readme provides an overview of the project and outlines the required tasks for setting up the server-side. 

## Back End

In this week, the focus will be on setting up the server-side of the project. We will cover the fundamental aspects of back-end development, including best practices. The technologies we will be using are Express.js and Node.js. These tools will allow us to create APIs and handle HTTP requests. To test and manage our APIs, we will utilize Postman, an API development and testing tool. 

## Postman

Postman is a powerful tool that enables developers to send and manage HTTP requests. It also provides features for analyzing and monitoring API responses. We will use Postman extensively throughout the project to ensure the proper functioning of our APIs. 

## API Immersion

To gain a better understanding of APIs and how to use them effectively, it is recommended to watch instructional videos and explore the abundant resources available on this topic. This will help us utilize APIs efficiently and make informed design decisions.

## Research Document

Please refer to the included text file (research_document.txt) for the answers to the following questions:

1. What is Node.js?
2. What is Express?
3. Explain three reasons why we chose Node Express for Rocket Elevators.

## Express Immersion

To enhance our knowledge and skills in working with Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, it is highly recommended to watch the resource titled "INTRODUCTION TO NODEJS, MONGODB, EXPRESS: BEGINNER TO INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT." This resource will provide valuable insights into these technologies.

## API GET

We need to create six APIs using the GET method. Here are the API endpoints and a brief explanation of each:

1. `/hello`: Returns a simple greeting message.
2. `/status`: Provides the current status of the system.
3. `/error`: Simulates an error response for testing purposes.
4. `/email-list`: Retrieves a list of email addresses.
5. `/region-avg`: Calculates and returns the average value for a specific region.
6. `/calc-residential`: Performs a calculation related to residential properties and returns the result.

Please ensure that each API is thoroughly explained and documented.

## API POST

We are setting up an API to handle contact form messages. Use the POST method and create the following API endpoint:

`/contact-us`: This API extracts the message fields from the POST request and stores them in our databases. For now, a confirmation message will be displayed in the console to indicate successful message submission.

## Checklist

Please download the provided checklist file and perform a comprehensive project check to ensure that all aspects are covered and functioning correctly.

Thank you for your attention. Let's make this project a success!
